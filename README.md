# CoBot-19
This is a easy to use rule-based chatbot that helps users to determine if they have Covid-19, the Flu or a Cold; based on the presence of certain symptoms.
To use it you just need to run the CoBot-19.py script.
For the HackUNO2021 hackathon. 

## Inspiration
We wanted to create a chatbot related to health.  

## What it does
The bot ask for the presence of certain symptoms capturing yes or no answers from the user.  Then it decides wether you have Covid, the flu or a cold. 

## How we built it
Using python with tkinter

## Challenges we ran into
Designing the system of points for the symptoms to make the decision. Creating the GUI for the script.
 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Designing the decision system. Implementing the GUI.

## What we learned
Learned that it is not necessary to use AI for a simple bot. Create and .exe for a python script. How to create a GUI for a python script. How to make simple interfaces to be used by any kind of user.

## What's next for CoBot-19
Being able to detect more respiratory diseases based on the same or added symptoms.
